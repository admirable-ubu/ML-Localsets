# Local set computation for multi-label data sets
Instance selection algorithms for MEKA. The algorithms LSSm and LSBo have been adapted to multi-label learning.

The original MEKA software is necessary: https://github.com/Waikato/meka

* HD-LSSm: Local set-based smoother for multi-label.
* HD-LSBo: Local set border selector for multi-label.
